# Quick Start

Get Snapiter running in minutes.

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) – Docker is used for the backend and frontend services.
- SMTP server – This is used to login into the system

## Set Up snapiter
### 1. Install Docker  
Snapiter runs entirely on Docker containers, the first step would be to install Docker.  
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system, then verify the installation

[How to install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

```bash
docker --version
```

### 2. Download configuration files
Snapiter uses a .env file to store configuration (like API keys and email settings)
and a docker-compose.yml which defines how to run snapiter.
Download both from the Snapiter demo repository:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapiter/demo/main/.env
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapiter/demo/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 3. Start the server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Congratulations!<br />
Snapiter is now running at http://localhost:8000

# Quick Start

Get Snapiter running in minutes.

## Requirements
- Docker – Docker is used for the backend and frontend services.
- SMTP server – This is used to for login

## Set Up the Server
### 1. **Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**  
Snapiter runs entirely inside Docker containers, so Docker must be installed first.  
Follow the instructions for your operating system, then verify the installation:
```bash
docker --version
```
### 2. Download configuration files
Snapiter uses a .env file to store configuration (like API keys and email settings)
and a docker-compose.yml file to define how the services run.
Download both from the Snapiter demo repository:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapiter/demo/main/.env
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapiter/demo/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 3. Start the server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Snapiter is now running at http://localhost:8000

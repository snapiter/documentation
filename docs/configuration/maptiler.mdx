The Trackable feature lets you follow anything that moves, your camper, boat, or even yourself.
Each trackable is linked to a unique hostname and can include multiple devices or trips, representing different journeys.

You can create and manage several trackables at once, making it easy to manage different adventures, vehicles, or people, all from one place.

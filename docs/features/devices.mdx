# Devices

A Device is what sends location data to your trackable.
You can use the official SnapIter Android app to automatically share your position, or connect through an alternative method using a unique device key.

This key allows you to integrate your own software or hardware, giving you full flexibility in how you provide location updates to your trackables.
